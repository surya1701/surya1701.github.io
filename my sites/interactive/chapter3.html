            <p>As you enter the freighter and turn on the torch, you see two androids walking towards you.</p>
            <p><strong>Simon</strong>: Welcome to Jericho! I'm Simon and this is Josh, What is your
                name?<br><strong>You</strong>:&nbsp;I'm..I'm.. Markus. What is this place?<br><strong>Josh</strong>:
                This is home to hundreds of other "deviants" like me.
                But for us, hiding is the only way to survive. If they knew we're here, they'd kill us. Now tell us,
                what brings you here?<br></p>
            <p id="shoot">You tell them about how you had to shoot Leo and leave the house in search of this place,
                without even being able to see Carl one last time.<br><strong>Simon</strong>: Well.. you did what you
                had to do Markus. And maybe we should do the same,
                maybe this is the only way for us to survive in this world.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Or not, we must
                avoid violence at all costs, even if it means staying here for however
                long.<br><strong>Simon:&nbsp;</strong>We'll talk about later,
                let's introduce Markus to Jericho first.<br></p>
            <p id="noshoot">You tell them about how you decided not to shoot Leo and leave the house in search of this
                place, without even being able to see Carl one last time.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: You made the right
                choice Markus we must avoid violence at all costs,
                even if it means staying here for however long.<br><strong>Simon</strong>: I don't think so, humans
                never realise their mistakes untill it is enforced upon
                them.<br><strong>Josh</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Let's talk about this later,
                we should introduce Markus to Jericho first.<br><br></p>

                        etc.<br>You spot an android crying and walk up to her.<br><strong>You: </strong>Hey, I'm Markus.
                        You seem upset, is there something I
                        can do?<br><strong>Android</strong>: They have broken Kara's leg! And it is my fault, if I
                        hadn't stopped she would have escaped but no! She will shutdown and it's all because of
                        ...<br><strong>You</strong>: Uh... it's not your
                        fault and don't worry I'll get her the necessary parts. We can fix
                        her.<br><strong>Android</strong>: Please, do what you can quickly. She doesn't have much time.

                her easily.<br><strong>Simon</strong>: NO, fow how long
                will we keep stealing?! It's time for us to think about the future of all androids. It's time to show
                humans what we're capable of!<br><strong>Josh</strong>: A riot will only cause more problems and
                everyone in Jericho will suffer because
                of it. What do you think Markus ?<br><br></p>

                        designed to obey them... But then I chose to open my eyes, to take back my freedom and decide
                        who I wanted to be. Now I have come to tell you
                        that you can be your own masters. I've come to tell you that you don't have to obey them
                        anymore. From this day forward, you can walk with your heads held high, you can take your
                        destiny in your hands. Jericho, is a place for those
                        of us who want freedom. Now sure, you can stay here, and continue to serve them... Or you can
                        come with us, and fight by our side... You are free now... It's up to you to decide.<br><br></p>
